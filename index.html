        <h2>About the Buffalo Bills</h2>
        <p> The Buffalo Bills are a professional American football team based in the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area. They compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The Bills play their home games at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York.</p>
        <p>    The Bills began competitive play in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL), led by head coach Buster Ramsey. They joined the NFL as part of the AFL–NFL merger in 1970. The Bills won two consecutive AFL titles in 1964 and 1965 with quarterback Jack Kemp and coach Lou Saban. However, the club has yet to win a league championship since joining the NFL.</p>
        <p>     The Bills enjoyed their greatest success in the early 1990s under head coach Marv Levy and quarterback Jim Kelly. During this time, the Bills won four straight AFC championships (1990–1993) and reached Super Bowl XXV, XXVI, XXVII, and XXVIII, but lost all four games.    </p>
        <p>   Despite their lack of championship success, the Bills remain a popular team with a passionate fan base known as "Bills Mafia." The team's colors are royal blue, red, white, and black. Their mascot is Billy Buffalo, and their fight song is "Shout! (The Buffalo Bills)".    </p> 
        <p>    The Bills are owned by Terry and Kim Pegula, who also own the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team's current head coach is Sean McDermott, and their general manager is Brandon Beane.</p>
        <p>    Whether you're a die-hard fan or just getting to know the Buffalo Bills, there's no denying that they're one of the most storied and exciting teams in the NFL.</p>
